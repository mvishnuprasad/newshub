  String description = "Reports of Saudi Arabia ending the longstanding petrodollar deal with the US "
      "emerged last week, sparking online discussions about the potential decline of the dollar as the world's reserve currency. "
      "However, amid growing speculation about the imminent decline of the US dollars global dominance, several experts highlighted "
      "a critical flaw about the end of the petrodollar deal, pointing out there was never an agreement to begin with Paul Donovan, the "
      "chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a blog post said that the story had gained unexpected traction, serving as yet "
      "another example of the dangers of “confirmation bias.The story seems to have started in the crypto world. Many crypto speculators "
      "desperately want to believe in the dollar’s demise, said Donovan.Reports emerged that an agreement signed between Saudi Arabia and "
      "the US in 1974, being termed as the 'petrodollar deal', was not renewed and expired on June 9, 2024.The economist explained that the"
      " arrangement may have been made due to Saudi Arabia's need to invest the excess revenue from its oil sales.The US and Saudi Arabia "
      "did establish a Joint Commission for economic cooperation in June 1974. This aim was to help Saudi Arabia spend its sudden glut of "
      "dollars on US products. In July of that year, Saudi agreed to invest oil dollars in US Treasuries (this was kept confidential until 2016),"
      " said Donovan in the blog post." ;
